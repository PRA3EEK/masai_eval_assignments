Q2) Why multiple Inheritance is not supported in Java at the class Level?
Answer: In java multiple inheritance is not allowed. let a class A which extends two classes B and C both. Both
        class B and C contains a method with same signature and if we try to call that method the compiler 
        will get confused which method to call weather from class B or from class C. So the compiler will 
        throw an error.
