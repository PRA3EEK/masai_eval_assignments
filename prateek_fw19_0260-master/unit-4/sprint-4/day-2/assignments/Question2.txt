Q2) What is the difference between ArrayList and Array?
Answer: Array in java has fixed size and we have to declare the size of the array while we create an Array obect.
        like if we want the size of the array to be 10 then we have to declare it like int[] arr = new int[10];
        and once we have created the array we cannot change it's size. Array in java can hold primitive datatypes
        as well as objects.
        While on the other hand ArrayList is like a dynamic array it can be defined without specifying its size.
        the default size of an ArrayList is 10 and if we try to add 11th element to it, a new array list will be
        created in the memory with the size equals to the sum of the previous ArrayList and the additional size 
        will be defined by the formula (currentCapacity*3/2) +1 and that 11th element will be added to it.
        In ArrayList we can only add Objects in it.
