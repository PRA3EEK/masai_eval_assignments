Q2) Explain about Hashcode and Equals Method.
Answer : 

     Hashcode and equals method both belongs to java.lang.Object class they both are interrelated to each other
     because if we call hashcode method on two objects which are equal to each other according to the equals 
     method then the hashcode method will return the same hash value, else if both the objects are not equal 
     according to the equals method then the hashcode method will return different hash values.
