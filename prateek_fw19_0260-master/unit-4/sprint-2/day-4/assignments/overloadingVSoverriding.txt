Q4) Explain the difference between overloading and overriding methods with an example?
Answer. 
1. Overriding implements Runtime Polymorphism whereas Overloading implements Compile time polymorphism.
2. The method Overriding occurs between superclass and subclass. Overloading occurs between the methods in the 
   same class.
3. Overriding methods have the same signature i.e. same name and method arguments. Overloaded method names are 
   the same but the parameters are different.
4. With Overloading, the method to call is determined at the compile-time. With overriding, the method call is 
   determined at the runtime based on the object type.
5. If overriding breaks, it can cause serious issues in our program because the effect will be visible at 
   runtime. Whereas if overloading breaks, the compile-time error will come and itâ€™s easy to fix.
