Q1) a) Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder? And Write
some of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.
Answer:  
String is immutable because java is a secure language one string object is created in the memory then we cannot
modify it to modify the string object we should use sting Builder it allows us to modify the string object.
some methods of Strings are :
1.  .concat();
   example:
   package sprint2evaluation;

public class Strings {
	static String S = new String("prateek");
	static String S2 = S.concat("chauhan");
  public static void main (String[] args) {
	  System.out.println(S);
	  System.out.println(S2);
  }
} 
 
2.  .toUpperCase();
   example:
   package sprint2evaluation;

public class Strings {
	static String S = new String("prateek");
	static String S2 = S.toUpperCase();
  public static void main (String[] args) {
	  System.out.println(S);
	  System.out.println(S2);
  }
} 
 
3.  .toLowerCase();
   example:
   package sprint2evaluation;

public class Strings {
	static String S = new String("PRATEEK");
	static String S2 = S.toLowerCase();
  public static void main (String[] args) {
	  System.out.println(S);
	  System.out.println(S2);
  }
} 
   
    
4.  .contains();

    example:
    package sprint2evaluation;

public class Strings {
	static String S = new String("PRATEEK");

  public static void main (String[] args) {
	  System.out.println(S.contains("TEEK"));
	  
  }
} 
    
    
5.  .equals();
   example: 
   package sprint2evaluation;

public class Strings {
	static String S = new String("PRATEEK");

  public static void main (String[] args) {
	  System.out.println(S.equals("PRATEEK"));
	  
  }
} 




Question 2:-   b) What is the difference between equals method and == operator in java? And what will be
 the output of the
following code snippets and giving proper explanation.
Code snippet 1 >
String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String("abc");
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));
Code snippet 2 >
StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder("abc");
StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder("abc");
System.out.println(sb1.equals(sb2));
Code snippet 3 >
String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String("abc");
System.out.println(s1==s2);

Answer: 
the difference between the equals method and == is simply that equals compare the reference of the object 
like their memory address. while == compare the value of the variable.

output of snippet one will be true as it is comparing the string values and they are equal.
output of snippet one will be true as it is again comparing the string values and they are again equal.
In snippet 3 it is comparing the addresses of the object created, the output will be true as the strings 
made by both the objects are equal so address of the location of s1 will also be given to s2.
