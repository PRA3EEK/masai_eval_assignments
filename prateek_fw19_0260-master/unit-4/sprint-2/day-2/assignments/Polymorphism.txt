Polymorphism is an ability provided by Java, polymorphism is simply a functionality of methods that we can make
many methods with same name with same parameters or different parameters so that we can use the same method to 
perform different tasks according to the parameters passed to it, basically polymorphism provides us the 
flexibility to perform different tasks using the same method.
We have to types of polymorphism in Java :


First one is static polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to behave differently for the same trigger.
Static polymorphism (Compile-time Polymorphism) Static Polymorphism decides which method to execute during
compile time.Method Overloading is an example of static polymorphism, and it is requred to happens static 
polymorphism. 


Second one is Dynamic polymorphism is a process or mechanism in which a call to an overridden method is to 
resolve at runtime rather than compile-time. It is also known as runtime polymorphism or dynamic method 
dispatch.We can achieve dynamic polymorphism by using the method overriding.
