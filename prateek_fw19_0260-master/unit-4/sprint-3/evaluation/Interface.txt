a) Does the below code compile successfully? If not, why?
interface A{
int i = 111;
}
class B implements A{
void methodB(){
i = 222;
}
}


Answer : The above code will not compile successfully as the interface A contains an initialized variable i
         But in java interface there should be no initialized variable, method/function because an interface 
         variable function/method are always supposed to be overriden by its implemented class.
