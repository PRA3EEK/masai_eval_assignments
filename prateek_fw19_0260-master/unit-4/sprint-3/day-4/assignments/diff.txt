Q3) Explain the difference between abstract class and interface.
Answer : 
   1.  An abstract class can have abstract and non abstract methods while an interface can only have abastract 
     methods but it can have non-abstract methods but with the keywords default and static only.
   2.  An abstract class cannot support multiple inheritence while an interface does support it.
   3.  An interface has only static and final variables while an interface can have static non-static final 
       nonfinal variables.
   4.  An abstract class can implement an interface while on the other hand interface can only implements 
       another interface.
   5.   A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc while members of interface 
        are public by default.
