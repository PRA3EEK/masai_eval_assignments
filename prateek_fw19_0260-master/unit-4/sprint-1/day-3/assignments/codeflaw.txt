Q4) Explain why the following block of code will give a compile time error?
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
float f=3.3;
System.out.println(f);
}
}
Also rectify this code.

Answer : The above code will give a compile time error because we are trying to define a decimal number as 
       float but in java all the decimal numbers are treated as double by default, and double is a 
       bigger primitive data type so in order to define a double as float we need to down caste the double 
       value to float.
       Below is the rectified code :-
       
       public class test {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		float f= (float)(3.3);
		System.out.println(f);
	}

}
