Q3) Change this block of code according to the given instruction and explain the output?

public class Demo {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
           int a = 64;
           int b = 70;
           byte c = a+b;//typecast (a+b) to byte
           System.out.println(c){
    }
 }
 Answer : In the above code we are adding to int values as bytes, as we know int is bigger than byte and we are
          converting a bigger value to a smaller value this type of casting is called as explicit type casting 
          and in explicit type casting we need to downcaste the higher value to lower value in order to get a 
          desired output like shown in below code :
          public class Demo {
             public static void main(String[] args) {
               int a = 64;
               int b = 70;
               byte c = (byte)(a+b);//typecast (a+b) to byte
               System.out.println(c);
         }
      }
         In the above case we are 64 and 70 as integers and the output should be 134 but when we convert the 
         sum in byte we found that the output is -122 this is because the range of byte value is from -128 to 127
         . In the above code clearly the output is exceeding the range of a byte so the value goes back into the 
         cycle and gives us the value -122.
