Q3/- How many types of relationships exist among tables in the
Database? Explain with some examples, and also mention how to
establish these relationships among tables with examples.

Answer: 
  ->  There are three types of relationship among tables in the database which\
      are shown below:-
      1. one to one
      2. one to many
      3. many to many
     
     
      one to one:
      in one to one relation a unique element of a table can have relation 
      with the unique element of another table and vice versa.
      take a real life example of a relation ship between a person and his/her
      driving liscence a person can have only one driving liscence and one 
      driving liscence can only be owned by only one person.
      to establish one to one relationship between two tables we need to two 
      table with atleast one primary key column in each tables.
      example:-
      create table person(
      person_id int primary key,
      person_name varchar(20),
      person_age int,
      person_address varchar(20),
      liscence_id int, 
      foreign key (liscence_id) references liscence(lid)
      );
      
      create table liscence(
      lid int primary key,
      person_id int.
      foreign key (person_id) references person(person_id)       
      );
      
      one to many:
      in one to many relation a unique element of one table can have relation
      with unique element from another table multple times. for example multiple
      persons can works in a work department of a company
      examle:
      creating department table;->
      
      create table department(
      did int primary key,
      dname varchar(20)
      );
      
      creating employee table:->
      
      create table employee(
      empid int primary key,
      ename varchar(20),
      address varchar(30),
      mobile varchar(10),
      deptid int,
      foreign key (deptid) references department (did)
      );
      // in the above example i am estabilishing one to many relationship 
      // between department table employee table we can add multiple emplyees
      // of different empid with same department/department id
      
      many to many:
      in this type of relationship multiple unique elements of one table can 
      relation with multiple unique elements form another table 
      to establish this kind of relationship among tables we will always need 
      the help of a third table.
     Take a real life example of relationship of a student with courses
     one student can enroll into multiple courses at the same time and one course
     can be enrolled by many students.
     
     example:
     //creating student table :->
      create table student (
    -> roll int primary key,
    -> name varchar(12) not null,
    -> address varchar(12) not null,
    -> mobile varchar(10) not null
    -> );
    
    //creating course table;->
    create table course (
    -> cid int primary key,
    -> cname varchar(12) not null,
    -> fee int not null,
    -> duration varchar(12) not null
    -> );
    
    // creating third helping table student_course
    create table student_course(
    -> student_roll int,
    -> course_enrolled int,
    -> foreign key(student_roll) references student(roll),
    -> foreign key(course_enrolled) references course(cid)
    -> );
    // the helping table will keep the record of the student enrolled in the 
        courses.
