Q1/- What is the Difference between the Statement and the PreparedStatement?
A: 

   If we use statement object to pass queries to our database it has some major drawbacks:-
    
   1: Complexities to concatenate the dynamic input into our query
   2: If we take the help of statement object for passing the query to our database it is not a direct proccess
      database engine will perform some functions in order to get our task done
      . DB engine will first compile the query
      . second it will generate a plan for the query
      . third query optimization 
      these above three steps will take place every time we try to execute the new query which will degrade 
      the performance of our application.
   3: SQL injection
      this happens we use statement object to pass query to the database and we ask user to input the 
      values for the desired output the suppose the user is some kind of hacker so he/she will directly pass
      the sql query in the form string and that query will become the sub query for our query and will execute 
      and may badly affect the data stored in the database.
      
   To overcome these above situations we use prepared statements instead of statement to pass our queries
   prepared statement will tell the db engine to not execute the three process every time we pass a query and
   will make our application faster and it also overcomes the situation of sql injection because PreparedStatement
   class holds some method through which we concatenate the dynamic values to our query and it verifies the 
   values before concatenating them to the string to it is a safe alternative.
