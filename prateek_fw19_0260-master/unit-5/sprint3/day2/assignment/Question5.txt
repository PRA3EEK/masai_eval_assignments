Q5/- What is the Difference between the sleep and join method .
A: sleep method is used to make a thread sleep/wait for a perticular time and we can give that in milliseconds 
   while we call the sleep method. like Thread.sleep(1000); the thread which will encounter this line or the thread
   object which we will call this method on will wait or pause for 1 second or 1000 millisecond before
   proceeding further and execute the remaining method. If we have small code which has to be executed and we 
   the given time to the sleep method is more then the thread will wait for extra seconds which is not nessecary 
   so our application will become slow. In that case we should use join method will join the two threads and 
   make them work one by one and the second thread will wait only for the time which is required by the first
   thread to execute the code. take an example of two threads:-
   
   first thread be t1 and second be t2;
   Thread t1 = new Thread();
   Thread t2 = new Thread();
   
   and we call the join method on t1 like t1.join() then the t2 thread will only start after the first thread 
   completes its task.
