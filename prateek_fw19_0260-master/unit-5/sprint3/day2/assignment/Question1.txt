Q1/ What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block?
A:  A synchronized method is method which is declared using the synchronized keyword. A Synchronized method
    can only be accessed by a single thread at a time, until one thread is not completed with executing the 
    method no other thread can execute the same synchronized method or any other synchronized method in the 
    whole class. If we want any method to be executed just by a single thread at a time than we should use 
    synchronized keyword in the method signature. Suppose if we have a lot of code which has to be executed 
    inside a method and we make it as a synchronized method than no other synchronized method can be executed 
    in the same class object so to overcome this problem there is an alternative which is synchronized block.
    Instead of making a whole method synchronized we can make some part of the method as synchronized by 
    wrapping that part in a synchronized block so that other lines which can be accessed by different threads 
    at same time can be executed by another thread and we can make our program faster by using synchronized
    blocks.
