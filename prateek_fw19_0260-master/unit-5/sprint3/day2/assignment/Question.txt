Q2/- Whatâ€™s the difference between class lock and object lock?
A :
        Class lock                                                 object lock
   
   1.Class locks are used by the static                     1. Object locks are used by the synchronized                   
     synchronized methods of a class.                          method of a class object.
   
   2.There is only one class lock for                       2. Every object of a class has its own ocject 
     a class.                                                  lock.
         
   3.It is used when you want a static                      3. It is used when we want a non-static method 
     method of class to be synchronized.                       of a class to be synchronized.
