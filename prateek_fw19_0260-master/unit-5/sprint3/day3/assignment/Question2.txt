Q2/ What is a ThreadPool, how to create a thread pool of 4 threads, and write down the
difference between the Callable and Runnable interface.
Answer: In java creating a thread is an expensive task suppose if we 6 different functions to perform then we 
        have to create 6 new threads which will result in the poor performance of our application so to 
        overcome this problem we have thread pools which were introduced in java 5. We can create thread pool 
        of 3 threads and we can supply 6 tasks to it, here single thread will be performing 2 tasks.
        
        We can create a thread pool of 4 threads by the below method
        ExecutorService ser = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
        
        difference between callable and runnable interfaces:->
        Callable interface 
        1. If you want your thread to return something then use callable interface.
        2. it has only one method public Object call() throws Exception.
        3. return type of the only method in callable interface is Object.
        4. If any Exception occurs here it is not necessary to use try and catch blocks.
        5. this interface belongs to java.util.concurrent package.
        6. Introduced from java 1.5 onwards.
        runnable interface 
        1. if the thread is not returning anything we use runnable interface.
        2. it has only one method public void run().
        3. the only method in runnable interface does not return anything.
        4. If any Exception occurs here it is always necessary to use try and catch blocks.
        5. this interface belongs to java.lang package.
        6. Introduced from java 1.0 onwards.
