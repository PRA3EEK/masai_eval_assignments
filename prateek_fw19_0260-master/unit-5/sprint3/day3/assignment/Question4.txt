Q4/ Explain about thread synchronization(inter-thread communication).
A: Inter-thread communication is just the different threads in java when communicate to each other by given 
   their current states to each other is inter thread communication.
   inter thread communication in java is possible by the following methods:
   wait()
   notify()
   notifyAll()
   these all above methods belongs to object class;
   example of interthread communication:->
   
   package day10Assignment;

public class ThreadA extends Thread{
  
  int prod = 1;
  @Override
	public void run() {
	  
	  
	 synchronized(this) {
		  for(int i=1; i<=10 ; i++) {
			  prod = prod * i;
		  }
		  System.out.println( Thread.currentThread().getName());

		  this.notify();
	 }
	
  }
  
}
   
   
   //main thread
   package day10Assignment;

public class MainThread {
  
	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
		ThreadA ta = new ThreadA();
		

		ta.start();
	
//		ta.join();
		synchronized(ta) {
			ta.wait();
			System.out.println(ta.prod);
		}
	
	}
	
}

In the above example main thread need to print the product which is being calculated by the threadA so theadA 
needs to be executed completely first so that main thread can print the correct output in that case we are using
wait and notify method notify will notify the thread when the threadA has executed the method until then main
thread will wait for the response of the threadA;
