Q5/- What is the difference between the sleep and wait method?
            wait()	                                                    sleep()
The wait() method releases the lock.	                     The sleep() method doesn't release the lock.

It should be notified by notify() or notifyAll() methods	 After the specified amount of time, sleep is completed.
