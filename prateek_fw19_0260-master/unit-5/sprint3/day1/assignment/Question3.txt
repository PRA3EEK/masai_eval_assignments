Q3) Differentiate between process and thread.
 process: A process is basically a program which is being run. Process needs more time to execute. Process 
 can create small processes which are called child processes or sub processes. A process is isolated as it 
 does not share its memory with any other processes so multiple processes needs more memory space. A process 
 takes more time to terminate.
 
 Thread: Thread is the segment of a process which means a process can have multiple threads and these 
 multiple threads are contained within a process. A thread has three states: Running, Ready, and Blocked. 
 The thread takes less time to terminate as compared to the process but unlike the process, threads do not 
 isolate.
