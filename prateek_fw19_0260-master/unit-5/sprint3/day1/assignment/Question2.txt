Q2) What are the benefits of using Multithreading?
1. Multithreading allows the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time.
   These parts are known as threads and are lightweight processes available within the process.
   So multithreading leads to maximum utilization of the CPU by multitasking.
2. Multi threaded appliations are fast.
3. If our main thread encounters an error than other threads will continue to do their work as the threads are 
   independent so the application will be executed even though the main thread has encountered an error.
