Q4) What are the different states of a thread, or what is thread lifecycle?
A: In java every thread executes the program and dies after completing its task so every thread has its 
   life cycle. Life cycle of a thread is reffered to the different states it goes through while executing a
   program.
   Thread always exists in any of the following states:
   1. New state
   2. Runnable state
   3. Running state
   4. Blocked state
   5. Dead state
