Q1) What do you mean by Multithreading? Why is it important?
A : Multithreading in java is meant by using more than one threads to implement our java program. Multi threads
    helps our program to execute faster as multiple threads are working on completing it. In a single threaded 
    application the program runs conventionaly line by line while using multi threads main thread divides in 
    multiple threads and execute the program at the same time so the program gets executed faster.
    Suppose we have an application where user checks the availability of seats in a train, In this situation if
    our application is single threaded than it is not possible for multiple users to access the application 
    at the same time so it becomes important to use multithreading.
