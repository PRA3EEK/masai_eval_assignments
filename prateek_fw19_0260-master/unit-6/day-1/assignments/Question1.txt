Question 1: Explain difference between PriorityQueue() and LinkedList().
Answer: Both priority queue and linked list implements queue data structure in java but there are some 
        differences in both of them. when we add and element to priority the class of that element must have
        implemented compareTo method form comparable interface because in priority the the elements will 
        get the priority on the basis of compareTo method which we have overridden and the priority queue will 
        be sorted only the basis of that compareTo method only and another difference id that the order in 
        which we have added the elements in the priority queue will not be preserved.
