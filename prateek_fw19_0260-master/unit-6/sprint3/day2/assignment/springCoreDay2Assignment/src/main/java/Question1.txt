Q/- What is a Spring Bean and Spring container? How to activate the Spring Container in our
application.

Answer:

Spring bean:-
- A spring bean class is simply a java class which is associated with the spring container of spring framework in the other words it is simply a pojo class.

Spring Container:-
- A spring container is the core of spring framework. It is not like the j2EE container i.e. (EJB container, Web container) so we don't need to install 
  any kind of server. It is a lightweight container unlike j2ee container so it can be activated in any kind of java application.
  
- The main functions of spring container are:-

  1. Life Cycle Management of Spring bean class:
    
     It manages the life cycle of the Spring bean class without implementing any interface in our spring bean class.
  
  2. Dependency resolution :
   
     It injects the values of the dependencies present in our spring bean classes according to the configuration defined in the applicationContainer.xml file
     
     or by using annotations.
     
     ================================================================================================================================================
  
- To Activate our spring container in our application first we need to create the applicationContext.xml in src/main/resources folder and then instantiate
   
  ClassPathXmlApplicationContext by giving the name of the our applicationContext file we created earlier as a parameter.
