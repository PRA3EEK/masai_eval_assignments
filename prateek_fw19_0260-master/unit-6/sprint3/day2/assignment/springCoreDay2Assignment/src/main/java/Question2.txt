Q2/- Explain about IOC and Dependency Injection.
Answer:

IOC :->

- In general when a class is dependent to an another class to perform it's own methods than it creates an object of its dependency class and calls 
  
  its methods this process is called dependency object creation in the main control.
  
- but when an external entity is responsible for injecting the dependency object to our spring bean class then it called that the control is inverted 
  
  to an external entity and this is called Inversion Of Control.
  
Dependency Injection:->

Injection of the dependent object to the dependence class through an external entity is called as dependency injection.

And we need to specify the values of the object in the applicationContainer.xm.
