● Explain difference between JPA and Hibernate.
● Explain the Life-cycle of Entity class with example.

answer1:

-JPA (Java persistence API) is a specification and Hibernate is the implementation build upon the guidlines of 
 JPA.

-JPA belongs to javax.persitence api while the api of Hibernate ORM is org.hibernate.

-If we use JPA in our application then our application can be run using any ORM which means our application 
 will become ORM independent while if we use HIbernate api then the application can only be used using Hibernate 
 only.
 
Answer2:

There are three stages of an entity class;
first-(Transient stage)
In this stage the object of entity class is not associated with any entity manager object to perform operations
in this stage the entity class object is ready to be used but is not being used.

second-(persistence stage)
In this stage the entity class object is in the use or being used with the entity manager class object to perform 
operations in the database.

third/last-stage(Detach stage)
In this stage the entity class object is again not in use as the operation has been completely done and 
the entity manager class we created is being successfully closed.
